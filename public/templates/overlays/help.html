<div class="overlay help">
    <p>This silly website can help you make mashups of content you find online.</p>

    <h2>Controls</h2>

    <p>Use the menu to add new content onto the page, or even edit the CSS / JavaScript if you're an advanced user.</p>

    <p>
        Once you've added something to the page, you can click and drag to move it around, or grab the edges to rotate and resize it.
        Double clicking on an object will open an overlay to edit its options.
    </p>

    <p>
        To remove something from the page, right click on it.
        If you hold the "control" key while right clicking, the element will explode.
    <p>

    <h2>Shortcuts</h2>

    <p>There are also a number of keyboard shortcuts you can use to make editing easier:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Escape - Open and close the menu</li>
        <li>More coming soon â„¢!</li>
    </ul>
